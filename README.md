## Manual Setup

If your agent doesn't support the `claude skill install` command, add the relevant `SKILL.md` path to your agent's context manually:

**Cursor** — the `.cursorrules` file at the root is automatically picked up.

**Claude Code** — add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:
```
Read skills/weaverse-hydrogen/SKILL.md before working on Weaverse components.
```

**GitHub Copilot** — add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
```
Refer to skills/weaverse-hydrogen/SKILL.md for Weaverse Hydrogen patterns.
```
