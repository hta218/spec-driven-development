# Shopify Hydrogen Skills

Agent skills for building, maintaining, and upgrading Shopify Hydrogen storefronts with Weaverse. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI, and any agent that supports markdown skill files.

## Quick Install

```bash
npx skills add Weaverse/shopify-hydrogen-skills
```

This auto-detects which coding agents you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Codex, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and 40+ more) and installs the skills to all of them. Powered by [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

> The repo will also appear on the [skills.sh leaderboard](https://skills.sh) automatically — no manual submission needed.

### Manual Install

If you prefer per-agent setup, read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for step-by-step instructions for each supported agent.

## Live Docs Strategy

Instead of baking static API docs into skill files, this repo ships **live doc fetching scripts** that query official sources at runtime:

| Script | Source | What it does |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `scripts/search_shopify_docs.mjs` | `shopify.dev` | Search Hydrogen API docs (same backend Shopify's AI Toolkit uses) |
| `scripts/search_weaverse_docs.mjs` | `docs.weaverse.io` | Search Weaverse documentation |
| `scripts/get_weaverse_page.mjs` | `docs.weaverse.io` | Fetch a full doc page by path |

```bash
# Search Shopify Hydrogen docs
node scripts/search_shopify_docs.mjs "createHydrogenContext"
node scripts/search_shopify_docs.mjs "CartForm actions"

# Search Weaverse docs
node scripts/search_weaverse_docs.mjs "component schema"
node scripts/search_weaverse_docs.mjs "data fetching"

# Fetch a specific Weaverse page
node scripts/get_weaverse_page.mjs "development-guide/component-schema"
```

The `references/` folders remain as offline fallback — they're cached snapshots that may not reflect the latest API changes.
