# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A collection of agent skills for building, maintaining, and upgrading Shopify Hydrogen storefronts with Weaverse. Skills are markdown knowledge bases that agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI, etc.) load to gain context before working on a Hydrogen project.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add Weaverse/shopify-hydrogen-skills
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for manual per-agent setup.

## Live Docs Strategy

Instead of baking static API docs into skill files (which go stale), this repo ships scripts that query official sources at runtime:

| Script | Source | What it does |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `scripts/search_shopify_docs.mjs` | `shopify.dev/assistant/search` | Search Hydrogen API docs |
| `scripts/search_weaverse_docs.mjs` | `docs.weaverse.io/mcp` | Search Weaverse docs (Mintlify) |
| `scripts/get_weaverse_page.mjs` | `docs.weaverse.io/mcp` | Fetch a full doc page by path |

Usage:
```bash
node scripts/search_shopify_docs.mjs "createHydrogenContext"
node scripts/search_weaverse_docs.mjs "component schema"
node scripts/get_weaverse_page.mjs "development-guide/component-schema"
```

All scripts use Node.js built-ins only (no dependencies needed). Require Node.js 18+.

## Content Sources

| Skill | Authoritative Source |
|-------|---------------------|
| `shopify-hydrogen/` | Live: `shopify.dev` via search script · Offline: `references/` |
| `weaverse-hydrogen/` | This repo — authored directly · Live: `docs.weaverse.io` via scripts |
| `hydrogen-cookbooks/` | Authored in this repo with Weaverse-specific patterns |
| `hydrogen-upgrades/` | Authored in this repo · Cross-check with `shopify.dev` via scripts |

**Rule:** Never write API docs from memory or training data. Use the scripts to fetch authoritative content.

## Skill File Format

Each `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "One-line description of what this skill covers and when to use it."
---
```

Followed by:
- Live Documentation section (script usage)
- Brief intro explaining the skill's scope
- Table of available references with short descriptions
- Usage notes for when/how to load the skill

## .cursorrules

Kept in sync with the skill content. Update when skills change.
